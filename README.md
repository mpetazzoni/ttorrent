Ttorrent, a Java implementation of the BitTorrent protocol
==========================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpetazzoni/ttorrent.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mpetazzoni/ttorrent)

Description
-----------

**Ttorrent** is a pure-Java implementation of the BitTorrent protocol,
providing a BitTorrent tracker, a BitTorrent client and the related Torrent
metainfo files creation and parsing capabilities. It is designed to be embedded
into larger applications, but its components can also be used as standalone
programs.

Ttorrent supports the following BEPs (BitTorrent enhancement proposals):

* `BEP#0003`: The BitTorrent protocol specification  
  This is the base official protocol specification, which Ttorrent implements
  fully.
* `BEP#0012`: Multi-tracker metadata extension  
  Full support for the `announce-list` meta-info key providing a tiered tracker
  list.
* `BEP#0015`: UDP Tracker Protocol for BitTorrent  
  The UDP tracker protocol is fully supported in the BitTorrent client to make
  announce requests to UDP trackers. UDP tracker support itself is planned.
* `BEP#0020`: Peer ID conventions  
  Ttorrent uses `TO` as the client identification string, and currently uses
  the `-T00042-` client ID prefix.
* `BEP#0023`: Tracker Returns Compact Peer Lists  
  Compact peer lists are supported in both the client and the tracker.
  Currently the tracker only supports sending back compact peer lists
  to an announce request.

History
-------

This tool suite was implemented as part of Turn's (http://www.turn.com) release
distribution and deployment system and is used to distribute new build tarballs
to a large number of machines inside a datacenter as efficiently as possible.
At the time this project was started, few Java implementations of the
BitTorrent protocol existed and unfortunately none of them fit our needs:

* Vuze's, which is very hard to extract from their codebase, and thus complex
to re-integrate into another application;
* torrent4j, which is largely incomplete and not usable;
* Snark's, which is old, and unfortunately unstable;
* bitext, which was also unfortunately unstable, and extremely slow.

This implementation aims at providing a down-to-earth, simple to use library.
No fancy protocol extensions are implemented here: just the basics that allows
for the exchange and distribution of files through the BitTorrent protocol.

Although the write performance of the BitTorrent client is currently quite poor
(~10MB/sec/connected peer), it has been measured that the distribution of a
150MB file to thousands of machines across several datacenters took no more
than 30 seconds, with very little network overhead for the initial seeder (only
125% of the original file size uploaded by the initial seeder).


How to use
----------

### As standalone programs

The client, tracker and torrent file manipulation utilities will all present a
usage message on the console when invoked with the ``-h`` command-line flag.

### As a library

To use ``ttorrent`` is a library in your project, all you need is to
declare the dependency on the latest version of ``ttorrent``. For
example, if you use Maven, add the following in your POM's dependencies
section:

```xml
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.turn</groupId>
      <artifactId>ttorrent</artifactId>
      <version>1.4</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

#### Client code

```java
// First, instantiate the Client object.
Client client = new Client(
  // This is the interface the client will listen on (you might need something
  // else than localhost here).
  InetAddress.getLocalHost(),

  // Load the torrent from the torrent file and use the given
  // output directory. Partials downloads are automatically recovered.
  SharedTorrent.fromFile(
    new File("/path/to/your.torrent"),
    new File("/path/to/output/directory")));

// You can optionally set download/upload rate limits
// in kB/second. Setting a limit to 0.0 disables rate
// limits.
client.setMaxDownloadRate(50.0);
client.setMaxUploadRate(50.0);

// At this point, can you either call download() to download the torrent and
// stop immediately after...
client.download();

// Or call client.share(...) with a seed time in seconds:
// client.share(3600);
// Which would seed the torrent for an hour after the download is complete.

// Downloading and seeding is done in background threads.
// To wait for this process to finish, call:
client.waitForCompletion();

// At any time you can call client.stop() to interrupt the download.
```

#### Tracker code

```java
// First, instantiate a Tracker object with the port you want it to listen on.
// The default tracker port recommended by the BitTorrent protocol is 6969.
Tracker tracker = new Tracker(new InetSocketAddress(6969));

// Then, for each torrent you wish to announce on this tracker, simply created
// a TrackedTorrent object and pass it to the tracker.announce() method:
FilenameFilter filter = new FilenameFilter() {
  @Override
  public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {
    return name.endsWith(".torrent");
  }
};

for (File f : new File("/path/to/torrent/files").listFiles(filter)) {
  tracker.announce(TrackedTorrent.load(f));
}

// Once done, you just have to start the tracker's main operation loop:
tracker.start();

// You can stop the tracker when you're done with:
tracker.stop();
```

Caveats
-------

* Client write performance is a bit poor, mainly due to a (too?) simple piece
  caching algorithm.

above!
