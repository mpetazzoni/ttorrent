Howto build and use the BitTorrent library
==========================================

Dependencies
------------

This Java implementation of the BitTorrent protocol implements a BitTorrent
tracker (an HTTP service), and a BitTorrent client. The only dependencies of
the BitTorrent library are:

* the log4j library
* the slf4j logging library
* the SimpleHTTPFramework

These libraries are provided in the lib/ directory, and are automatically
included in the JAR file created by the build process.


Building the distribution JAR
-----------------------------

Simply execute the following command:

  $ mvn package

To build the library's JAR file (in the target/ directory). You can then import
this JAR file into your Java project and start using the Java BitTorrent
library.
